# MyReads Project

## To get started :
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`

## How to use
* Books are showed in specific shelves (read, want to read and currently reading) 
* You can move them from one shelf to another by clicking on the book and selecting the desired shelf
* You can add new book to your shelves by clicking the "Add a book" button
* On the search page, simply type a book's name to find it and click it to add it to the desired shelf
