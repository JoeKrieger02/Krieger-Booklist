# MyReads Project (REACT)

## Functionalities 
* Search for new books with keywords
* Add books to a specific bookshelf 
* The bookshelf value is saved between the search page and the front page and linked to each specific book
* Search bar queries multiple words


## To get started :
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`

## How to use
* Books are showed in specific shelves (read, want to read and currently reading) 
* You can move them from one shelf to another by clicking on the book and selecting the desired shelf
* You can add new book to your shelves by clicking the "Add a book" button
* On the search page, simply type a book's name to find it and click it to add it to the desired shelf

## Credits
* Code made with the help and guidance of "ERIC", my actual Udacity mentor
